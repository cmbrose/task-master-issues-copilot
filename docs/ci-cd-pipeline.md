# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The Task Master Issues repository implements a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that provides automated build, test, security scanning, and deployment capabilities. The pipeline ensures code quality, security, and reliable releases.

## Pipeline Components

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`ci-cd-pipeline.yml`)

The primary workflow that orchestrates build automation, testing, and quality checks.

#### Triggers
- **Push**: To `main` and `develop` branches when code files change
- **Pull Request**: To `main` and `develop` branches
- **Manual**: Via `workflow_dispatch` with options to skip tests or deploy

#### Jobs

##### Build and Compile
- TypeScript compilation and linting
- Dependency caching for performance
- Version extraction and artifact upload
- Build artifact retention for 30 days

##### Code Quality Analysis
- Security audit with `npm audit`
- Dependency vulnerability checking
- CodeQL static analysis
- Outdated dependency detection

##### Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Jest-based unit tests with coverage reporting
- **Integration Tests**: Workflow validation and API integration tests
- **Action Validation**: YAML syntax and action structure validation
- Coverage upload to Codecov

##### Action Testing
- Matrix-based testing of all GitHub Actions
- Individual action validation (generate, breakdown, watcher, composite)
- End-to-end action functionality verification

##### Performance Testing
- Load testing scenarios
- Performance validation suite
- Benchmark collection and storage

##### Deployment
- Automated releases triggered by `[deploy]` commit message
- Git tag creation and GitHub release generation
- Release artifact preparation

#### Usage

```yaml
# Automatically triggered on push/PR
# Manual trigger with options:
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    skip-tests: false    # Skip test execution
    deploy: false        # Deploy after successful build
```

### 2. Security Scanning (`security-scanning.yml`)

Dedicated security workflow for vulnerability detection and code analysis.

#### Features
- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit` with configurable severity levels
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog for credential scanning
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL security-focused analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker image vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Review**: Automated license and vulnerability checks for PRs

#### Schedule
- Daily execution at 2 AM UTC
- On-demand via workflow dispatch
- Triggered by pushes to main branch

### 3. Release Deployment (`release-deployment.yml`)

Automated release management and GitHub Action marketplace updates.

#### Triggers
- Git tags matching `v*` pattern
- Manual dispatch with version input

#### Features
- **Release Validation**: Version extraction and tag verification
- **Build Artifacts**: Complete release package creation
- **Release Notes**: Automated changelog generation
- **Marketplace Update**: Major version tag management
- **Asset Upload**: Distribution packages and documentation

## Testing Framework

### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `src/tests/`
- **Framework**: Jest with TypeScript support
- **Coverage**: Targets 90% code coverage
- **Execution**: `npm run test:unit`

### Integration Tests
- **Trigger Tests**: Workflow configuration validation
- **Action Tests**: GitHub Action functionality verification
- **API Tests**: GitHub API integration validation
- **Execution**: Various `npm run test:*` commands

### Performance Tests
- **Load Testing**: Simulated high-volume scenarios
- **Benchmark Collection**: Performance metric tracking
- **Regression Detection**: Performance comparison analysis

## Security Measures

### Dependency Security
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Dependency review for pull requests
- Regular audit schedules

### Code Security
- Static analysis with CodeQL
- Secret scanning with TruffleHog
- Container image vulnerability scanning
- Security-focused code quality rules

### Access Control
- Minimal required permissions
- Environment-based deployment controls
- Token scoping and rotation guidance

## Quality Gates

### Build Quality
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- Linting compliance
- Unit test passage
- Integration test validation

### Security Quality
- No high-severity vulnerabilities
- Secret scanning clearance
- License compliance
- Container security validation

### Performance Quality
- Load test completion
- Performance regression checks
- Benchmark collection

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Flow
1. **Feature Branch**: Create feature branch from `develop`
2. **Pull Request**: Submit PR with automated testing
3. **Review**: Code review and CI/CD validation
4. **Merge**: Merge to `develop` after approval

### Release Flow
1. **Release Branch**: Create release branch from `develop`
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on release branch
3. **Tag**: Create version tag to trigger release
4. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to GitHub Marketplace
5. **Post-Release**: Monitor and collect feedback

### Hotfix Flow
1. **Hotfix Branch**: Create from `main` for critical fixes
2. **Fast Track**: Expedited testing and review
3. **Emergency Deploy**: Direct deployment with monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
# Required for CI/CD
GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

# Optional for enhanced features
CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

### Workflow Inputs
```yaml
# CI/CD Pipeline
skip-tests: boolean      # Skip test execution
deploy: boolean          # Deploy after successful build

# Security Scanning
# (No inputs - automatic execution)

# Release Deployment
version: string          # Version to release (e.g., v1.2.3)
create-tag: boolean      # Create new tag if needed
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Pipeline Status
- GitHub Actions status badges
- Step summary generation
- Artifact retention policies
- Performance metric collection

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage reporting
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks
- Dependency health status

### Alerts and Notifications
- Build failure notifications
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Performance degradation warnings
- Release completion confirmations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
The CI/CD pipeline runs automatically on code changes:

```yaml
# Triggered automatically on:
# - Push to main/develop
# - Pull requests
# - Scheduled security scans
```

### Manual Deployment
```yaml
# Manual workflow dispatch
name: Manual Deploy
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      deploy:
        description: 'Deploy after build'
        required: false
        default: 'true'
        type: boolean
```

### Release Creation
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3

# Or use manual workflow dispatch
# with version input: v1.2.3
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures
- Check Jest configuration in `jest.config.js`
- Verify test file structure in `src/tests/`
- Review setup file at `src/tests/setup.ts`

#### Build Failures
- Verify TypeScript configuration
- Check dependency compatibility
- Review linting errors

#### Security Scan Failures
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Rotate detected secrets
- Address CodeQL findings

#### Deployment Issues
- Verify version tag format
- Check release branch protection
- Validate action.yml syntax

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm run test:unit
npm run test:triggers
npm run test:generate

# Validate workflows
npx js-yaml .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml

# Check security
npm audit
npm outdated
```

## Best Practices
