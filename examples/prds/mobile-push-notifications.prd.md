## Technical Implementation

### Mobile App Components

#### iOS Implementation (Swift)
```swift
// NotificationManager.swift
class NotificationManager: NSObject {
    static let shared = NotificationManager()
    
    func requestPermission() {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(
            options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]
        ) { granted, error in
            // Handle permission response
        }
    }
    
    func registerForPushNotifications() {
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
        }
    }
    
    func handleNotificationReceived(_ notification: UNNotification) {
        // Process received notification
    }
}
```

#### Android Implementation (Kotlin)
```kotlin
// NotificationManager.kt
class NotificationManager {
    companion object {
        private const val CHANNEL_ID = "default_channel"
        
        fun createNotificationChannel(context: Context) {
            if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
                val channel = NotificationChannel(
                    CHANNEL_ID,
                    "Default Notifications",
                    NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT
                )
                val notificationManager = context.getSystemService(
                    Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE
                ) as NotificationManager
                notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)
            }
        }
        
        fun showNotification(context: Context, title: String, body: String) {
            // Display notification implementation
        }
    }
}
```

  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  target_audience JSONB,
  scheduled_at TIMESTAMP,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Notification deliveries
CREATE TABLE notification_deliveries (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  campaign_id UUID REFERENCES notification_campaigns(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  device_token VARCHAR(255),
