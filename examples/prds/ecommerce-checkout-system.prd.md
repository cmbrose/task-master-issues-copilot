- `DELETE /api/cart/items/:id` - Remove cart item
- `DELETE /api/cart` - Clear entire cart

##### Checkout Process
- `POST /api/checkout/validate` - Validate cart and shipping
- `POST /api/checkout/calculate` - Calculate taxes and shipping
- `POST /api/checkout/payment-intent` - Create payment intent
- `POST /api/checkout/complete` - Complete order

##### Order Management
- `GET /api/orders` - Get user's orders
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get specific order
- `POST /api/orders/:id/cancel` - Cancel order
- `POST /api/orders/:id/refund` - Request refund

#### Database Schema

```sql
-- Shopping carts
CREATE TABLE shopping_carts (

  session_id VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Cart items
CREATE TABLE cart_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  cart_id UUID REFERENCES shopping_carts(id),
  product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
  quantity INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
  price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
