# Build Artifact Upload and Storage System Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Build Artifact Upload and Storage System as specified in issue #238. The solution ensures that `task-graph.json` is uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts at the specific path `artifacts/taskmaster/task-graph.json` with comprehensive metadata, retention policies, and structured logging.

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Upload task-graph.json to artifacts/taskmaster/task-graph.json path**
- Modified the artifact upload logic to create the proper directory structure
- Artifacts are now uploaded with the correct path: `artifacts/taskmaster/task-graph.json`
- Changed artifact name from generic 'task-graph' to 'taskmaster-artifacts'

✅ **Implement artifact retention policies**
- Preserved existing configurable retention system
- Retention days and maximum artifact count are fully configurable
- Integration with artifact cleanup system maintained

✅ **Create artifact metadata with PRD source, task count, and generation timestamp**
- Comprehensive metadata collection including:
  - PRD version extracted from source files
  - Task count (total, leaf tasks, hierarchy depth)
  - Generation timestamp
  - File size information
  - Retention policy settings
  - All metadata exported as GitHub Action outputs

✅ **Ensure artifacts are accessible for replay workflows**
- Artifacts uploaded with proper structure for replay workflows
- Maintained compatibility with existing ArtifactManager system
- Directory structure allows easy extraction of task graph file

✅ **Add structured logging for artifact operations**
- Detailed logging throughout the upload process
- Clear indication of artifact path and structure
- Comprehensive metadata logging
- Error handling with cleanup logging

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

1. **Modified `actions/taskmaster-generate/src/main.ts`:**
   - Updated `uploadTaskGraphArtifact` function to create `artifacts/taskmaster/` directory structure
   - Added proper cleanup logic with finally block
   - Enhanced logging to show artifact path information

2. **Updated `.github/workflows/taskmaster-generate.yml`:**
   - Removed duplicate artifact upload step that was creating redundant artifacts
   - Updated summary text to reflect the new artifact path

3. **Added comprehensive testing:**
   - Created `test-artifact-path.ts` to verify directory structure creation
   - Created `test-complete-flow.ts` for end-to-end testing
   - All existing tests continue to pass

### Code Example

```typescript
// Create the required directory structure for artifacts/taskmaster/task-graph.json
tempArtifactDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'temp_artifacts');
const artifactTaskmasterDir = path.join(tempArtifactDir, 'artifacts', 'taskmaster');
const artifactTaskGraphPath = path.join(artifactTaskmasterDir, 'task-graph.json');

// Ensure the directory structure exists
fs.mkdirSync(artifactTaskmasterDir, { recursive: true });

// Copy the task graph to the required path
fs.copyFileSync(taskGraphPath, artifactTaskGraphPath);

// Upload artifact with the required directory structure
const uploadResponse = await artifactClient.uploadArtifact(
  'taskmaster-artifacts',
  [artifactTaskGraphPath],
  tempArtifactDir,
  {
    retentionDays: config.retentionDays
  }
);
```

## Testing Verification

All tests pass successfully:

- ✅ Artifact capabilities test
- ✅ Artifact retention configuration test  
- ✅ Directory structure creation test
- ✅ Complete end-to-end flow test
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ YAML workflow validation

## Impact and Benefits

1. **Compliance**: Meets the exact requirement for `artifacts/taskmaster/task-graph.json` path
2. **No Regression**: All existing functionality preserved
3. **Better Organization**: Artifacts now follow a structured directory layout
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant artifact uploads
5. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Improved logging and metadata tracking

## Minimal Changes Approach

The implementation follows the principle of minimal changes:
- Only modified the specific upload logic that needed to change
- Preserved all existing metadata, retention, and logging functionality
- Did not alter the ArtifactManager or replay systems (as not required by the issue)
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflows

This implementation successfully addresses all requirements while maintaining system stability and following best practices for minimal code changes.
